Hello Data Science Club,
 
Happy New Year! I trust you’ve enjoyed the long break from classes. To all you first years in interviews already, good luck!
 
We received feedback last semester that members would enjoy a friendly competition as a way of learning new data science skills. As NFL playoffs kick off, those sporting matchups seem like a good topic, but this analysis could be applied to any league of head-to-head competitions. The website FiveThirtyEight, a news website focused on analytics, published a challenge to predict the winners of upcoming NFL games more accurately than their existing system. The website is very user-friendly and uses Brier Score, so you get more points if you were right with a high degree of confidence. 
 
In order to come up with a model that will beat theirs, we need data, which they freely provide. The Tech Club put on an R training workshop in the fall and we hope to collaborate with them on a more advanced one this spring. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend installing RStudio, a free application, on your machines. I’ve attached my “starter code” for this topic in R. It briefly covers data cleansing and exploration, feature engineer, model development, and model evaluation. It does not yet improve on FiveThirtyEight’s system, but I think it has the potential to. For FYs, this is likely your first introduction to regression trees, random forests and boosted trees, which are used extensively in the SY Data Science course. Feel free to explore online resources on those unfamiliar topics, or simply brainstorm additional explanatory variables which would improve a logistic regression. We will hold a debrief session to discuss strategies for this challenge; we want you to see this a collaboration rather than a competition.
 
Good luck, and feel free to reach out with questions.
