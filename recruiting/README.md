is a functional group within McKinsey born from a need expressed by clients to 
have consultants with deeper data science knowledge and change management. It is 
integrated within projects such that the typically staffing would be a Data Scientist,

actually a number of even more specialized teams (Journey Analytics, Healthcare Analytics

## Interview Prep

Subscribe to [https://www.interviewqs.com](https://www.interviewqs.com) for 3 questions 
each week. These are a fairly good sample of brain teasers and general knowledge that 
will be tested throughout the interview process. 

There is an article called [20 Questions to Detect Fake Data Scientists](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/01/20-questions-to-detect-fake-data-scientists.html). It is 
worth taking a look so that you do not get tripped up by not knowing the answer to 
one of these questions. Hopefully they spur some more in-depth research on the 
topics if they are unfamiliar to you.
