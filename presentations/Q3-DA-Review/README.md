# Q3 DA Review
This folder repository contains one Excel spreadsheet for download that is used 
for teaching a review session on Hypothesis Testing, t-Tests, and Regression. 

## Overview

The Excel file has one sheet for each of the three concepts mentioned above. There 
are three additional sheets that have the breakdown and analysis of a regression model 
built for the regression problem. Walk through each of the examples and make sure to 
emphasize that the **yellow highlighted cells are samples of answers or conclusions that 
would be important to make on the exam**. 

DA exams are all about documenting your work and results rather than getting the 
right answer. If you can demonstrate how hypothesis testing works, then you have 
achieved more than someone that can click a bunch of buttons because an understanding 
of the process will help you understand your colleagues at work who use this same 
framework to make decisions.
