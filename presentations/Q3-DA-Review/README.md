# Q3 DA Review
This folder repository contains one [Excel spreadsheet](<DA Review - Data Science Club.xlsx>) 
for download that is used to teach a review session on the following concepts: 

 1. Hypothesis Testing (one and two-tailed)
 2. t-Tests
 3. Regression

## Overview

The Excel file has one sheet for each of the 3 concepts mentioned above. There 
are 3 additional sheets that have the breakdown and analysis of a regression model 
built for the regression problem. Walk through each of the examples and make sure to 
emphasize that the **yellow highlighted cells** denote samples of answers or conclusions 
that would be important to include in an exam answer response.

## The DA Exams

DA exams are all about documenting your work and results rather than getting the 
right answer. If you can demonstrate your understanding of the hypothesis testing process, 
then you have achieved more than someone that can click a bunch of buttons. An understanding 
of the process will help you understand your colleagues at work who use this same 
framework to make decisions.
